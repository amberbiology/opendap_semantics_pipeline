Increasing amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide from human industrial activities are causing changes in global ocean carbon chemistry resulting in a reduction in pH, a process termed ocean acidification. Studies have demonstrated adverse effects on calcifying organisms, particularly some invertebrates, corals, sea urchins, pteropods, and coccolithophores. It is important to determine which species are sensitive to elevated levels of CO2 because of the potential impacts to ecosystems, marine resources, biodiversity, food webs, populations and effects on human communities and economies. There have been few studies examining the effects of ocean acidification on marine fish, particularly the juvenile stages of species that support important fisheries. These data demonstrated that elevated levels of pCO2 (>1300 micro-atm) had no statistically significant effect on growth, survival, or otolith condition after 8 weeks of rearing. There was a trend towards a greater gain in weight and length in scup exposed to the mid-level (1726 micro-atm) and the high level (2614 micro-atm) treatments of pCO2 when compared to the fish in the control (1205 micro-atm) treatments, but these differences were not statistically significant. X-ray analysis of the fish revealed a slightly higher incidence of hyper-ossification in the vertebrae of a few scup from the highest treatments compared to fish from the control treatments. The results show that juvenile scup are tolerant to increases in levels of environmental pCO2, possibly due to conditions this species encounters in their naturally variable environment. To determine whether varying levels of PCO2 have any effect on length, weight, otolith size, otolith shape or otolith mass of juvenile scup. 8/24/2011 10/19/2011 -73.05 -73.05 41.21 41.21 WGS 84 Long Island Sound Wepawaug River NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program Otolith Condition and Growth of Juvenile Scup, Stenotomus chrysops,and Embryonic and Larval Development in the Black Sea Bass (Centriopristis striat spp.) OAPFY13.03.NEFSC.004 Perry, Dean M.; Redman, Dylan H.; Widman, James C.
