XYZ values are derived from a 10m resolution gridding process.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. A comma delimited ASCII XYZ file was then exported from the BASE surface.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.</abstract> <purpose>This multibeam data was collected as IOCM (Integrated Ocean and Coastal Mapping) project NF-05-05 during the second year of an ongoing NOAA scientific research mission in the US Caribbean to characterize nearshore coral reef habitats at depths down to 300 meters. The mission purpose is to better understand the resources within the surveyed reef habitats, and ultimately develop species utilization models linking physical habitats with biological information. The multibeam backscatter, multibeam bathymetry, and ground truth video footage collected during the 2005 mission will be used internally to characterize sea floor topography and to create benthic habitat maps, helping NOAA meet its mapping commitment to the US Coral Reef Task Force. The resulting publicly-distributed data is also a contribution to the greater scientific community interested in the USVI seafloor.</purpose> <supplinf>None Information about Depth Resolution: See Data Acquisition and Processing Report (DAPR) for cruise number NF-05-05.</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20050201</begdate> <enddate>20050212</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>As needed</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-64.986219</westbc> <eastbc>-64.821862</eastbc> <northbc>18.225159</northbc> <southbc>18.171908</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt> CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus </themekt> <themekey> Geographic Information > Bathymetry </themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt> CoRIS Theme Thesaurus </themekt> <themekey> EARTH SCIENCE > Oceans > Bathymetry/Seafloor Topography > Bathymetry </themekey> <themekey> EARTH SCIENCE > Biosphere > Aquatic Habitat > Reef Habitat > Description </themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>NOS Data Explorer Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>Bathymetry/Topography</themekey> <themekey>Environmental Monitoring</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>USVI</themekey> <themekey>US Virgin Islands</themekey> <themekey>Bathymetry</themekey> <themekey>XYZ</themekey> <themekey>Multibeam</themekey> <themekey>SWMB</themekey> <themekey>Raster</themekey> <themekey>NOAA</themekey> <themekey>Biogeography</themekey> <themekey>Nancy Foster</themekey> <themekey>Reson 8101</themekey> <themekey>Seafloor</themekey> <themekey>GIS</themekey> <themekey>Habitat</themekey> <themekey>MBES</themekey> <themekey>NF-05-05</themekey> <themekey>Benthic</themekey> <themekey>Sonar</themekey> <themekey>NPS</themekey> <themekey>Reef</themekey> <themekey>Coral</themekey> <themekey>IOCM</themekey> <themekey>Integrated Ocean and Coastal Mapping</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>elevation</themekey> <themekey>006</themekey> <themekey>environment</themekey> <themekey>007</themekey> <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey> <themekey>008</themekey> <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey> <themekey>010</themekey> <themekey>oceans</themekey> <themekey>014</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>USVI</placekey> <placekey>US Virgin Islands</placekey> <placekey>St. Thomas</placekey> <placekey>Grammanik</placekey> <placekey>Grammanik Bank</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt> CoRIS Place Thesaurus </placekt> <placekey> OCEAN BASIN > Atlantic Ocean > Caribbean Sea > Virgin Islands > Leeward Islands > St. Thomas (18N064W0033) </placekey> <placekey> COUNTRY/TERRITORY > United States of America > U.

Data was collected aboard the NOAA ship Nancy Foster from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05, as project number NF-05-05-VI. Multibeam data was acquired in GSF format with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz), with options 033, 037, and 040. Reson backscatter snippet collection was enabled. SAIC ISS 2000 software was used to interface with the Reson system. Line spacing for acquisition was three times the water depth, and data was retained out to 60 or 70 degrees from nadir, depending on project area. Heave, roll, pitch and heading correctors were collected using an Applanix POS/MV Model 320 inertial measurement unit (IMU) and associated Trimble GPS antennas. Sound velocity profiles were acquired with a Seabird Electronics SeaCat SBE19P CTD profiler and processed using Seabird Seaterm software, then applied directly to the raw GSF data. Positioning was obtained using Northstar 941X GPS receivers with differential correctors from U.S. Coast Guard CORS beacon Isabel, Puerto Rico. Data was reduced to Mean Lower-Low Water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS, based on National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) primary tide stations at Charlotte Amalie, VI (9751639) and Lime Tree Bay, VI (9751401).</procdesc> <srcused>NF-05-05 GSF Raw Multibeam Data</srcused> <procdate>200502</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Raw SWMB data in GSF (generic sensor format) format were converted and processed using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software, resulting in a CARIS HDCS format dataset with all correctors applied.
