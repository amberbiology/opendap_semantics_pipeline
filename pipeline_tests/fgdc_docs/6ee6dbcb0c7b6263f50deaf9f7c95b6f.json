TheHigh Plains aquifer extends from south of 32 degrees to almost 44 degrees northlatitude and from 96 degrees 30 minutes to 104 degrees west longitude.  The aquiferunderlies about 174,000 square miles in parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska,New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming.This digital data set was created from 5,233 wells measured in both 1980 and1997.  The water-level-change contours were drawn manually on mylar at a scale of1:1,000,000.  The contours then were converted to a digital map.\t\t\t</abstract>\t\t\t<purpose>This data set was created to document the original map (McGuire, V.L. and Fischer,B.C., 1999) produced by the High Plains Water-Level Monitoring project and to makeavailable the data on this map for use with geographic information systems.\t\t\t</purpose>\t\t\t<supplinf>Introduction --The information provided in this introduction is found in U.S. GeologicalSurvey Professional Paper 1400-B (Gutentag and others, 1984). This data setconsists of digital water-level-change contours for the High Plainsaquifer in the United States, 1980 to 1997. The High Plains aquifer, whichunderlies about 174,000 square miles in parts of eight states, is the principalwater source in one of the nation's major agricultural areas.  In 1980, about170,000 wells pumped water from the aquifer to irrigate about 13 million acres.The High Plains aquifer is a regional water-table aquifer consisting mostly ofnear-surface sand-and-gravel deposits.  In 1980, the maximum saturated thicknessof the aquifer was about 1,000 feet and averaged about 200 feet.  Hydraulicconductivity and specific yield of the aquifer depend on sediment types, whichvary significantly both horizontally and vertically.  Hydraulic conductivityranged from less than 25 to greater than 300 feet per day and averaged 60 feetper day.  Specific yields ranged from less than 10 to 30 percent and averagedabout 15 percent.The High Plains aquifer boundaries were determined by erosional extent of associatedgeologic units and by hydraulic and physiographic boundaries where the High Plainsaquifer extends eastward from the Great Plains physiographic province (Fenneman,1931).  In most of the area, the erosional extent of the hydraulically connectedTertiary and Quaternary deposits were used as the aquifer boundary.  In easternNebraska, streams and physiographic boundaries were used as the aquifer boundary.Reviews Applied to Data --This electronic report was subjected to the same review standards that apply toall U.S. Geological Survey reports.  Reviewers were asked to check the topologicalconsistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, andgeographic extent.  Reviewers were given digital data sets for checking against thesource maps to verify the linework and attributes.  The reviewers checked themetadata files for completeness and accuracy.Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --Predevelopment to 1980 water-level change digital data set1980 to 1994 water-level change digital data set1980 to 1995 water-level change digital data set1980 to 1996 water-level change digital data setReferences Cited --Fenneman, N.M., 1931, Physiography of western United States (1st ed.): New York,McGraw-Hill, 534 p.Gutentag, E.D., Heimes, F.J., Krothe, N.C., Luckey, R.R., and Weeks, J.B., 1984,Geohydrology of the High Plains aquifer in parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska,New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming: U.S. Geological SurveyProfessional Paper 1400-B, 63 p.McGuire, V.L., and Fischer, B.C., 1999, Water-level changes ,1980 to 1997, and saturated thickness, 1996-97, in the High Plains        aquifer: U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet FS-124-99.Notes --Any use of trade, product, or firm names is for descriptive purposesonly and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.Although this data set has been used by the U.S. Geological Survey,U.S. Department of the Interior, no warranty expressed or implied ismade by the U.S. Geological Survey as to the accuracy of the data andrelated materials.The act of distribution shall not constitute any such warranty, andno responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the useof this data, software, or related materials.Although this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant metadatafile is intended to document the data set in nonproprietary form,as well as in ARC/INFO format, this metadata file may include someARC/INFO-specific terminology.\t\t\t</supplinf>\t\t</descript>\t\t<timeperd>\t\t\t<timeinfo>\t\t\t\t<sngdate>\t\t\t\t\t<caldate>1999</caldate>\t\t\t\t</sngdate>\t\t\t</timeinfo>\t\t\t<current>1997</current>\t\t</timeperd>\t\t<status>\t\t\t<progress>Complete</progress>\t\t\t<update>None Planned</update>\t\t</status>\t\t<spdom>\t\t\t<bounding>\t\t\t\t<westbc>-106.015</westbc>\t\t\t\t<eastbc>-96.260</eastbc>\t\t\t\t<northbc>43.806</northbc>\t\t\t\t<southbc>31.652</southbc>\t\t\t</bounding>\t\t</spdom>\t\t<keywords>\t\t\t<theme>\t\t\t\t<themekt>none</themekt>\t\t\t\t<themekey>aquifers</themekey>\t\t\t\t<themekey>ground water</themekey>\t\t\t\t<themekey>groundwater</themekey>\t\t\t\t<themekey>High Plains aquifer</themekey>\t\t\t\t<themekey>Ogallala Formation</themekey>\t\t\t\t<themekey>Ogallala aquifer</themekey>\t\t\t\t<themekey>water-level change</themekey>\t\t\t\t<themekey>inlandWaters</themekey>\t\t\t</theme>\t\t\t<place>\t\t\t\t<placekt>none</placekt>\t\t\t\t<placekey>High Plains</placekey>\t\t\t\t<placekey>Great Plains region</placekey>\t\t\t\t<placekey>western U.S.</placekey>\t\t\t</place>\t\t</keywords>\t\t<accconst>none</accconst>\t\t<useconst>These data are not to be used at scales greater than 1:1,000,000\t\t</useconst>\t\t<ptcontac>\t\t\t<cntinfo>\t\t\t\t<cntperp>\t\t\t\t\t<cntper>Virginia L.

ARC/INFO commands are shown belowin capitals.Step 1. Copied the aquifer boundary with the internal areaswhere the aquifer is not present using the COPY command.  This coveragewas projected to Albers Equal-Area projection with the 1927 North AmericanDatum using ARC/INFO.  The projection has standard parallel of 29 degrees30 minutes and 45 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, a central meridian of96 degrees west longitude, and a latitude of projection origin of 23 degreesnorth latitude.Step 2. Used the coverage from step one to register to the digitizer.The RMS error was 0.003 meters.Step 3. Digitized the water-level change contours from the mylar.ARCSNAP was turned on to snap water-level contours to the aquiferboundary.Step 4. Built polygon topology using BUILD command.Step 5.
