Quickbird imagery used in producing this land cover product was also utilized in producing an associated impervious surfaces layer for the island. The mapping approach utilized a boundary summary and refinement procedure developed by Sanborn to leverage previous United States Forest Service mapping efforts to create the high resolution land cover data set. A calibration visit was conducted and training data was collected for classification. Non impervious features were mapped using a 0.5 acre minimum mapping unit (MMU).Pre-processing steps:The Quickbird mosaic utilized for this project was provided from Digital Globe as an orthorectifed, georeferenced product and was consistent with the quoted 1:12000 spatial accuracy. In conjunction with the Quickbird mosaic, Sanborn used LiDAR collected in 2007 for the island.Field-Collected Data:Training data was collected in the field between March 14th and 27th, 2008.  Land cover observations were recorded by analysts.  The referenced dataset went through a QA/QC procedure to ensure it met accuracy standards.Classification:Segmentation - Image segmentation was completed at multiple scales using the multispectral (2.4 m) imagery in order to group like spectral and textural objects within the imagery. For consistency, the associated impervious data set was incorporated into the segmentation layer as a boundary delimiter. Segments can share boundaries of an impervious surface, but can never overlap an impervious surface.Automated Classification  degrees- Image segments are classified using a decision tree classifier in See5 software and an iterative nearest neighbor classifier in Definiens software.  Nearest neighbor training data is collected through analyst interpretation or ancillary data sets and used to calibrate the classification algorithm.Automated Classification Refinement - Models are built to refine or reclassify land cover areas by utilizing the wealth of attribute information linked to each segment within Definiens.Classification Edits - As with any automated or semi-automated land cover classification there are often inconsistencies in the land cover map. The final step before map finalization was to remove inaccuracies through manual segment labeling as interpreted by an analyst.Map Finalization - Sanborn used independent reviewer degrees's comments to further refine the land cover map.Attributes for this product are as follows:0\tBackground1\tUnclassified2\tImpervious345\tDeveloped, Open Space6\tCultivated Crops7\tPasture/Hay8\tGrassland/Herbaceous9\tDeciduous Forest10\tEvergreen Forest11\tMixed Forest12\tScrub/Shrub13\tPalustrine Forested Wetland14\tPalustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland15\tPalustrine Emergent Wetland16\tEstuarine Forested Wetland17\tEstuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland18\tEstuarine Emergent Wetland19\tUnconsolidated Shore20\tBare Land21\tOpen Water22\tPalustrine Acquatic BedFor the 2011 Guam update mapping effort, analysts identified misregistration errors between source 2005 Quickbird imagery and the 2011 Worldview2 in several areas. To reduce the amount of spurious changes results in the spectral change detection, the 2005 Quickbird imagery was co-registered to the 2011 Worldview 2 which had a higher spatial accuracy. This process was performed using the AutoSync module in ERDAS Imagine. To ensure there was no misregistration between the 2005 land cover and the geometrically corrected Quickbird imagery, the 2005 land cover was inserted as a layer in the original Quickbird image stack prior to geometric correction and exported as a thematic dataset afterwards.</procdesc>\t\t\t\t<procdate>20090731</procdate>\t\t\t\t<proccont>\t\t\t\t\t<cntinfo>\t\t\t\t\t\t<cntorgp>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<cntorg>NOAA Office for Coastal Management</cntorg>\t\t\t\t\t\t</cntorgp>\t\t\t\t\t\t<cntaddr>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<address>2234 South Hobson Avenue</address>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<city>Charleston</city>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<state>SC</state>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<postal>29405-2413</postal>\t\t\t\t\t\t</cntaddr>\t\t\t\t\t\t<cntvoice>843-740-1202</cntvoice>\t\t\t\t\t\t<cntemail>coastal.info@noaa.gov</cntemail>\t\t\t\t\t</cntinfo>\t\t\t\t</proccont>\t\t\t</procstep>\t\t\t<procstep>\t\t\t\t<procdesc>Metadata imported</procdesc>\t\t\t\t<procdate>20090731</procdate>\t\t\t\t<proccont>\t\t\t\t\t<cntinfo>\t\t\t\t\t\t<cntorgp>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<cntorg>NOAA Office for Coastal Management</cntorg>\t\t\t\t\t\t</cntorgp>\t\t\t\t\t\t<cntaddr>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<address>2234 South Hobson Avenue</address>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<city>Charleston</city>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<state>SC</state>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<postal>29405-2413</postal>\t\t\t\t\t\t</cntaddr>\t\t\t\t\t\t<cntvoice>843-740-1202</cntvoice>\t\t\t\t\t\t<cntemail>coastal.info@noaa.gov</cntemail>\t\t\t\t\t</cntinfo>\t\t\t\t</proccont>\t\t\t</procstep>\t\t</lineage>\t</dataqual>\t<spdoinfo>\t\t<direct>Raster</direct>\t\t<rastinfo>\t\t\t<rasttype>Pixel</rasttype>\t\t\t<rowcount>19850</rowcount>\t\t\t<colcount>15849</colcount>\t\t\t<vrtcount>1</vrtcount>\t\t</rastinfo>\t</spdoinfo>\t<spref>\t\t<horizsys>\t\t\t<planar>\t\t\t\t<gridsys>\t\t\t\t\t<gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn>\t\t\t\t\t<utm>\t\t\t\t\t\t<utmzone>55</utmzone>\t\t\t\t\t\t<transmer>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<sfctrmer>0.999600</sfctrmer>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<longcm>-159.000000</longcm>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<latprjo>0.000000</latprjo>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<feast>500000.000000</feast>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<fnorth>0.000000</fnorth>\t\t\t\t\t\t</transmer>\t\t\t\t\t</utm>\t\t\t\t</gridsys>\t\t\t\t<planci>\t\t\t\t\t<plance>row and column</plance>\t\t\t\t\t<coordrep>\t\t\t\t\t\t<absres>2.400000</absres>\t\t\t\t\t\t<ordres>2.400000</ordres>\t\t\t\t\t</coordrep>\t\t\t\t\t<plandu>meters</plandu>\t\t\t\t</planci>\t\t\t</planar>\t\t\t<geodetic>\t\t\t\t<horizdn>D_WGS_1984</horizdn>\t\t\t\t<ellips>WGS_1984</ellips>\t\t\t\t<semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis>\t\t\t\t<denflat>298.257224</denflat>\t\t\t</geodetic>\t\t</horizsys>\t</spref>\t<eainfo>\t\t<detailed>\t\t\t<enttyp>\t\t\t\t<enttypl>Layer_1</enttypl>\t\t\t\t<enttypd>Island of Guam delineated by Quickbird Scene(s) collected on May 01, 2006.</enttypd>\t\t\t\t<enttypds>unknown</enttypds>\t\t\t</enttyp>\t\t\t<attr>\t\t\t\t<attrlabl>Value</attrlabl>\t\t\t\t<attrdef>Landcover Classification as determined by NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP)</attrdef>\t\t\t\t<attrdefs>NOAA Office for Coastal Management High-Resolution Land Cover Project</attrdefs>\t\t\t\t<attrdomv>\t\t\t\t\t<edom>\t\t\t\t\t\t<edomv>1 Unclassified</edomv>\t\t\t\t\t\t<edomvd>This class contains nodata due to cloud conditions or data voids.</edomvd>\t\t\t\t\t\t<edomvds>N/A</edomvds>\t\t\t\t\t</edom>\t\t\t\t</attrdomv>\t\t\t\t<attrdomv>\t\t\t\t\t<edom>\t\t\t\t\t\t<edomv>2 Impervious Surfaces</edomv>\t\t\t\t\t\t<edomvd>Anthropogenic features such as buildings, parking lots and roads developed from asphalt, concrete or other constructed surfaces which do not allow infiltration from precipitation.</edomvd>\t\t\t\t\t\t<edomvds>NOAA Office for Coastal Management High-Resolution Land Cover Project.</edomvds>\t\t\t\t\t</edom>\t\t\t\t</attrdomv>\t\t\t\t<attrdomv>\t\t\t\t\t<edom>\t\t\t\t\t\t<edomv>5 Open Spaces Developed</edomv>\t\t\t\t\t\t<edomvd>Includes areas with a mixture of some constructed materials, but mostlyvegetation in the form of lawn grasses.
